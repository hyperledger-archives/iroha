       * achieved

       * outcome from storage. Outcome with votes is propagated to the network
       * in this state.
       *
       * kSentNotProcessed - outcome was propagated in the network
       * AND it was not passed to pipeline. State can be set in two cases:
       * 1. Outcome is received from the network. Some node has already achieved
       * an outcome and has propagated it to the network, so the first state is
       * skipped.
       * 2. Outcome was propagated to the network
       * Outcome is passed to pipeline in this state.
       *
       * kSentProcessed - outcome was propagated in the network
       * AND it was passed to pipeline. Set after passing proposal to pipeline.
       * This state is final. Receiving a network message in this state results
       * in direct propagation of outcome to message sender.
