/*

Programmers who have available to them 64-bit time values as a 'long
long' type can use localtime64_r() and gmtime64_r() which correctly
converts the time even on 32-bit systems. Whether you have 64-bit time
values will depend on the operating system.

localtime64_r() is a 64-bit equivalent of localtime_r().

gmtime64_r() is a 64-bit equivalent of gmtime_r().

   TIME_64_DEBUG

   If you define these symbols Under Linux/glibc, you either need to define _BSD_SOURCE before including time.h,
