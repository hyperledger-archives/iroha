Blockchain platform Hyperledger Iroha is designed for simple creation and management of assets. This is a distributed ledger of transactions.

Check [overview](http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) page of our documentation.

Iroha has the following features:
1. Creation and management of custom complex assets, such as currencies or indivisible rights, serial numbers, patents, etc.
2. Management of user accounts
3. Taxonomy of accounts based on _domains_ — or _sub-ledgers_ in the system
4. The system of rights and verification of user permissions for the execution of transactions and queries in the system
5. Validation of business rules for transactions and queries in the system

Among the non-functional requirements can be noted a high degree of network fault tolerance _(Byzantine Fault Tolerant)_.

## Documentation

Check [getting started](http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/) section in your version of localized docs to start exploring the system.

For more information, such as how to use client libraries in your target programming language, or how to deploy Iroha in a network check the rest of the documentation.
