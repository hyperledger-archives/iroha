Iroha is a straightforward distributed ledger technology (DLT), inspired by Japanese Kaizen principle — eliminate excessiveness (muri). 
Iroha has essential functionality for your asset, information and identity management needs, at the same time being an efficient and trustworthy byzantine fault-tolerant tool for your enterprise needs.
