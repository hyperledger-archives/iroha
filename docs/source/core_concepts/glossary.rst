Account
=======

An Iroha entity that is able to perform specified set of actions.
Each account belongs to one of existing `domains <#domain>`__.

An account has some number of `roles <#role>`__ (can be none) — which is a collection of permissions.
Only `grantable permissions <#grantable-permission>`__ are assigned to an account directly.

Ametsuchi
=========

Iroha storage component,
which stores blocks and a state generated from blocks,
called `World State View <#world-state-view>`__.
There is no way for the `client <#client>`__ to directly interact with Ametsuchi.

Asset
=====

Any countable commodity or value.
Each asset is related to one of existing `domains <#domain>`__.
For example, an asset can represent any kind of such units -
currency unit, a bar of gold, real estate unit, etc.

Block
=====

Transaction data is permanently recorded in files called blocks.
Blocks are organized into a linear sequence over time (also known as the block chain) [#f1]_.

Blocks are signed with the cryptographic signatures of Iroha `peers <#peer>`__,
voting for this block during `consensus <#consensus>`__.
Signable content is called payload, so the structure of a block looks like this:

*Outside payload*

    - hash — SHA3-512 hash of block protobuf payload
    - signatures — signatures of peers, which voted for the block during consensus round

*Inside payload*

    - height — a number of blocks in the chain up to the block
    - timestamp — Unix time (in milliseconds) of block forming by a peer
    - body — transactions, which successfully passed validation and consensus step
    - transactions quantity
    - previous hash of a block

Block Creator
=============

System component that forms a block from a set of transactions that
have been passed `stateless <#stateless-validation>`__ and `stateful <#stateful-validation>`__
validation for further propagation to `consensus <#consensus>`__.

Client
======

Any application that uses Iroha is treated as a client.

A distinctive feature of Iroha is that all clients are using simple client-server abstractions
when they interact with a peer network: they don't use any abstractions
which are specific for blockchain-related systems.
For example, in Bitcoin clients have to validate blocks,
or in Fabric they need to poll several peers to make sure that a transaction was written in a block,
whereas in Iroha a client interacts with any peer similarly to a single server.

Command
=======

A command is an intention to change the `state <#world-state-view>`__.
For example, in order to create a new `role <#role>`__ in Iroha you have to issue
`Create role <../api/commands.html#create-role>`__ command.

Consensus
=========

A consensus algorithm is a process in computer science used to achieve agreement
on a single data value among distributed processes or systems.
Consensus algorithms are designed to achieve reliability
in a network involving multiple unreliable nodes.
Solving that issue -- known as the consensus problem
-- is important in distributed computing and multi-agent systems.

*Consensus, as an algorithm*

    An algorithm to achieve agreement on a block among peers in the network. By having it in the system, reliability is increased.

*Consensus, as a component*

    Preserves consistent state among the `peers <#peer>`__ within a peer network.
    Iroha uses own consensus algorithm called Yet Another Consensus (aka YAC).
    Distinctive features of this algorithm are its scalability, performance,
    and `Byzantine fault tolerance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance>`_.
    If there are missing blocks, they will be downloaded from another peer via `Synchronizer <#synchronizer>`__.
    Committed blocks are stored in `Ametsuchi <#ametsuchi>`__ block storage.

Domain
======

A named abstraction for grouping `accounts <#account>`__ and `assets <#asset>`__.

Ordering Gate
=============

Internal Iroha component that passes `transactions <#transaction>`__
from `Peer Communication Service <#peer-communication-service>`__ to `Ordering Service <#ordering-service>`__.
Ordering Gate eventually recieves `proposals <#proposal>`__ from Ordering Service
and sends them to `Simulator <#simulator>`__ for `stateful validation <#stateful-validation>`__.

Ordering Service
================

Internal Iroha component that combines several `transactions <#transaction>`__
that have been passed `stateless validation <#stateless-validation>`__ into a `proposal <#proposal>`__.
Proposal creation could be triggered by one of the following events:

1. Time limit dedicated to transactions collection has expired.

2. Ordering service has received the maximum amount of transactions allowed for a single proposal.

Both parameters (timeout and maximum size of proposal) are configurable (check `environment-specific parameters <../guides/configuration.html#environment-specific-parameters>`_ page).

A common precondition for both triggers is that at least one transaction should reach ordering service.
Otherwise, no proposal will be formed.

Peer
====

A node that is a part of Iroha network.
It participates in `consensus <#consensus>`_ process.

Peer Communication Service
==========================

Internal component of Iroha - an intermediary that transmits `transaction <#transaction>`__
from `Torii <#torii>`__ to `Ordering Gate <#ordering-gate>`__.
The main goal of PCS is to hide the complexity of interaction
with consensus implementation.

Permission
==========

A named rule that gives the privilege to perform a command.
Permission **cannot** be granted to an `account <#account>`__ directly,
instead, an account has roles, which are the collection of permissions.

`List of Iroha permissions <../maintenance/permissions.html>`_.

Grantable Permission
--------------------

Only grantable permission is given to an `account <#account>`__ directly.
An account that holds grantable permission is allowed to perform some particular
action on behalf of another account.
For example, if the account a@domain1 gives the account b@domain2 a permission
that it can transfer assets —
then  b@domain2 can transfer assets of a@domain1 to anyone.

Proposal
========

A set of `transactions <#transaction>`__ that
have passed only `stateless validation <#stateless-validation>`__.

Verified Proposal
-----------------

A set of transactions that have been passed `stateless <#stateless-validation>`__
and `stateful <#stateful-validation>`__ validation, but were not committed yet.

Query
=====

A request to Iroha that does **not** change the `state <#world-state-view>`__.
By performing a query, a client can get request data from the state,
for example a balance of his account, a history of transactions, etc.

Quorum
======

In the context of transactions signing, quorum number is a minimum amount
of signatures required to consider a transaction signed.
The default value is 1.
Each account can link additional public keys and increase own quorum number.

Role
====

A named abstraction that holds a set of `permissions <#permission>`__.

Signatory
=========

Represents an entity that can confirm multisignature transactions for some `account <#account>`__.
It can be attached to account via `AddSignatory <../api/commands.html#add-signatory>`__ and detached via `RemoveSignatory <../api/commands.html#remove-signatory>`__.

Simulator
=========

See `Verified Proposal Creator <#verified-proposal-creator>`__.

Synchronizer
============

Is a part of `consensus <#consensus>`__.
Adds missing blocks to `peers' <#peer>`__ chains (downloads them from other peers).

Torii
=====

⛩.
Entry point for `clients <#client>`__.
Uses gRPC as a transport.
In order to interact with Iroha anyone can use gRPC endpoints,
described in `Commands <../api/commands.html>`__ and `Queries <../api/queries.html>`__ sections,
or use `client libraries <../guides/libraries.html>`__.

Transaction
===========

An ordered set of `commands <#command>`__, which is applied to the ledger atomically.
Any nonvalid command within a transaction leads to rejection of the whole
transaction during the validation process.

Transaction Structure
---------------------

**Payload** stores all transaction fields, except signatures:

    - Time of creation (unix time, in milliseconds)
    - Account ID of transaction creator (username@domain)
    - Quorum field (indicates required number of signatures)
    - Repeated commands which are described in details in `commands section <../api/commands.html>`__
    - Batch meta information (optional part). See `Batch of Transactions`_ for details


**Signatures** contain one or many signatures (ed25519 public key + signature)

Reduced Transaction Hash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reduced hash is calculated over transaction payload excluding batch meta information.
Used in `Batch of Transactions`_.


Transaction Statuses
--------------------

Hyperledger Iroha supports both push and pull interaction mode with a client.
A client that uses pull mode requests status updates about transactions from
Iroha peer by sending transaction hashes and awaiting a response. In contrary push
interaction is done over the listening of an event stream for each transaction.
In any of these modes, the set of transaction statuses is the same:

 .. image:: ./../../image_assets/tx_status.png

Transaction Status Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - NOT_RECEIVED: requested peer does not have this transaction.
 - MST_EXPIRED: this transactions is a part of MST pipeline and has expired.
 - STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED: the transaction was formed with some fields, not meeting stateless validation constraints. This status is returned to a client, who formed transaction, right after the transaction was sent. It would also return the reason — what rule was violated.
 - STATELESS_VALIDATION_SUCCESS: the transaction has successfully passed stateless validation. This status is returned to a client, who formed transaction, right after the transaction was sent.
 - STATEFUL_VALIDATION_FAILED: the transaction has commands, which violate validation rules, checking state of the chain (e.g. asset balance, account permissions, etc.). It would also return the reason — what rule was violated.
 - STATEFUL_VALIDATION_SUCCESS: the transaction has successfully passed stateful validation.
 - COMMITTED: the transaction is the part of a block, which gained enough votes and is in the block store at the moment.

Pending Transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any transaction that has lesser signatures at the moment than `quorum`_ of transaction creator account is considered as pending.
Pending transaction will be submitted for `stateful validation`_ as soon as `multisignature <#multisignature-transactions>`__ mechanism will collect required amount of signatures for quorum.

Transaction that already has quorum of signatures can also be considered as pending in cases
when the transaction is a part of `batch of transactions`_ and there is a not fully signed transaction.

Batch of Transactions
=====================

*The feature is to be released.*

Transactions batch is a feature that allows sending several transactions to Iroha at once preserving their order.

Each transaction within a batch includes batch meta information.
Batch meta contains batch type identifier (atomic or ordered) and a list of `reduced hashes <#reduced-transaction-hash>`_
of all transactions within a batch.
The order of hashes prescribes transactions sequence.

Batch can contain transactions created by different accounts.
Any transaction within a batch can require single or `multiple <#multisignature-transactions>`__ signatures (depends on quorum set for an account of transaction creator).
At least one transaction inside a batch should have at least one signature to let the batch pass `stateful validation`_.

Atomic Batch
------------

All the transactions within an atomic batch should pass `stateful validation`_ for the batch to be applied to a ledger.

Ordered Batch
-------------

Ordered batch preserves only the sequence of transactions applying to a ledger.
All the transactions that able to pass stateful validation within a batch will be applied to a ledger.
Validation failure of one transaction would NOT directly imply the failure of the whole batch.

Multisignature Transactions
===========================

A transaction which has the `quorum`_ greater than one is considered as multisignature (also called mst).
To achieve `stateful validity <#stateful-validation>`__ the confirmation is required by the `signatories <#signatory>`__ of the creator account.
These participants need to send the same transaction with their signature.

Validator
=========

There are two kinds of validation - stateless and stateful.

Stateless Validation
--------------------

Performed in `Torii <#torii>`__.
Checks if an object is well-formed, including the signatures.

Stateful Validation
-------------------

Performed in `Verified Proposal Creator <#verified-proposal-creator>`__.
Validates against `World State View <#world-state-view>`__.

Verified Proposal Creator
=========================

Internal Iroha component that performs `stateful validation <#stateful-validation>`_
of `transactions <#transaction>`__ contained in received `proposal <#proposal>`__.
On the basis of transactions that have been passed stateful validation **verified proposal**
will be created and passed to `Block Creator <#block-creator>`__.
All the transactions that have not passed stateful validation will be dropped
and not included in a verified proposal.

World State View
================

WSV reflects the current state of the system, can be considered as a snapshot.
For example, WSV holds information about an amount of `assets <#asset>`__
that an `account <#account>`__ has at the moment but does not contain any info
history of `transaction <#transaction>`__ flow.
