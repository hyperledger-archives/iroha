Queries
=======

A query is a request related to certain part of World State View — the latest state of blockchain.
Query cannot modify the contents of the chain and a response is returned
to any client immediately after receiving peer has processed a query.

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

The validation for all queries includes:

- timestamp — shouldn't be from the past (24 hours prior to the peer time) or from the future (range of 5 minutes added to the peer time)
- signature of query creator — used for checking the identity of query creator
- query counter — checked to be incremented with every subsequent query from query creator
- roles — depending on the query creator's role: the range of state available to query can relate to to the same account, account in the domain, to the whole chain, or not allowed at all

Get Account Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

To get the state of all assets in an account (a balance), `GetAccountAssets` query can be used.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetAccountAssets {
        string account_id = 1;
    }

Request Structure
-----------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    message AccountAssetResponse {
        repeated AccountAsset acct_assets = 1;
    }

    message AccountAsset {
        string asset_id = 1;
        string account_id = 2;
        string balance = 3;
    }

    "3", "Invalid signatures", "Signatures of this query did not pass validation", "Add more signatures and make sure query's signatures are a subset of account's signatories"

Get Account Detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

To get details of the account, `GetAccountDetail` query can be used. Account details are key-value pairs, splitted into writers categories. Writers are accounts, that added the corresponding account detail. Example of such structure is:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

Here, one can see four account details - "age", "hobbies" and "sports" - added by two writers - "account@a_domain" and "account@b_domain". All of these details, obviously, are about the same account.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetAccountDetail {
      oneof opt_account_id {
        string account_id = 1;
      }
      oneof opt_key {
        string key = 2;
      }
      oneof opt_writer {
        string writer = 3;
      }
    }

.. note::
    Pay attention, that all fields are optional. Reasons will be described later.

Request Structure
-----------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

        "Account ID", "account id to get details from", "<account_name>@<domain_id>", "account@domain"
        "Key", "key, under which to get details", "string", "age"
        "Writer", "account id of writer", "<account_name>@<domain_id>", "account@domain"

Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message AccountDetailResponse {
      string detail = 1;
    }

Response Structure
------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

        "Detail", "key-value pairs with account details", "JSON", "see below"

Possible Stateful Validation Errors
-----------------------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Code", "Error Name", "Description", "How to solve"

    "1", "Could not get account detail", "Internal error happened", "Try again or contact developers"
    "2", "No such permissions", "Query's creator does not have any of the permissions to get account detail", "Grant the necessary permission: individual, global or domain one"
    "3", "Invalid signatures", "Signatures of this query did not pass validation", "Add more signatures and make sure query's signatures are a subset of account's signatories"

Usage Examples
--------------

Again, let's consider the example of details from the beginning and see how different variants of `GetAccountDetail` queries will change the resulting response.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id is not set**

If account_id is not set - other fields can be empty or not - it will automatically be substituted with query creator's account, which will lead to one of the next cases.

**only account_id is set**

In this case, all details about that account are going to be returned, leading to the following response:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18,
            "hobbies": "crypto"
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id and key are set**

Here, details added by all writers under the key are going to be returned. For example, if we asked for the key "age", that's the response we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18
        },
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20
        }
    }

**account_id and writer are set**

Now, the response will contain all details about this account, added by one specific writer. For example, if we asked for writer "account@b_domain", we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@b_domain": {
            "age": 20,
            "sports": "basketball"
        }
    }

**account_id, key and writer are set**

Finally, if all three field are set, result will contain details, added the specific writer and under the specific key, for example, if we asked for key "age" and writer "account@a_domain", we would get:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "account@a_domain": {
            "age": 18
        }
    }

Get Asset Info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

In order to get information on the given asset (as for now - its precision), user can send `GetAssetInfo` query.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetAssetInfo {
        string asset_id = 1;
    }

Request Structure
-----------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Asset ID", "asset id to know related information", "<asset_name>#<domain_id>", "jpy#japan"


Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message Asset {
        string asset_id = 1;
        string domain_id = 2;
        uint32 precision = 3;
    }

.. note::
    Please note that due to a known issue you would not get any exception if you pass invalid precision value.
    Valid range is: 0 <= precision <= 255

Get Role Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Purpose
-------

To get available permissions per role in the system, a user can send `GetRolePermissions` query to Iroha network.

Request Schema
--------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message GetRolePermissions {
        string role_id = 1;
    }

Request Structure
-----------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Role ID", "role to get permissions for", "existing role in the system", "MoneyCreator"

Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message RolePermissionsResponse {
        repeated string permissions = 1;
    }

Response Structure
------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

To get new blocks as soon as they are committed, a user can invoke `FetchCommits` RPC call to Iroha network.

Request Schema
--------------

No request arguments are needed


Response Schema
---------------

.. code-block:: proto

    message BlockQueryResponse {
      oneof response {
        BlockResponse block_response = 1;
        BlockErrorResponse block_error_response = 2;
      }
    }

Please note that it returns a stream of `BlockQueryResponse`.

Response Structure
------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Block", "Iroha block", "only committed blocks", "{ 'block_v1': ....}"
