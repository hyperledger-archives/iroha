Commands
========

A command changes the state, called World State View, by performing an action over an entity (asset, account) in the system.
Any command should be included in a transaction to perform an action.

Add asset quantity
------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^

The purpose of add asset quantity command is to increase the quantity of an asset on account of transaction creator.
Use case scenario is to increase the number of a mutable asset in the system, which can act as a claim on a commodity (e.g. money, gold, etc.)

Schema
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: proto

    message AddAssetQuantity {
        string asset_id = 1;
        string amount = 2;
    }

.. note::
    Please note that due to a known issue you would not get any exception if you pass invalid precision value.
    Valid range is: 0 <= precision <= 255


Structure
^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Field", "Description", "Constraint", "Example"
    :widths: 15, 30, 20, 15

    "Asset ID", "id of the asset", "<asset_name>#<domain_id>", "usd#morgan"
    "Amount", "positive amount of the asset to add", "> 0", "200.02"

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Asset and account should exist
2. Added quantity precision should be equal to asset precision
3. Creator of a transaction should have a role which has permissions for issuing assets

Possible Stateful Validation Errors
