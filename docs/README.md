# Iroha reStructuredTest documentation

The purpose of this documentation is to convey design and architecture aspects of Iroha ledger in a structured approach, as well as operational side: how-tos, guides, and examples. Docs are accessible via ReadTheDocs website, and can be generated to a lot of formats, available in Sphinx. In order to contribute, one should to be familiar with [reStructuredTest](docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) syntax, and follow principles described in this file.

## Principles

 * modify only the contents of `image_assets` and `source` folders
 * if new section/file is added — it should be placed in the list of contents
 * if any new principle is added — it should be discussed in GitHub issues first, as an improvement proposal

## Setup

 Generally, the docs are available via ReadTheDocs website. Although, to check the result locally, you can build them manually, by following this routine:

### Prerequisites

 * Python 2.7 or Python 3.3+, and pip installed
 * Installed [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/install.html)
 * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in docs/source

### Build steps

1. `cd docs/source`
1. `make html`

After that, the documentation is generated in html format in `_build` folder. You can check another formats on Sphinx website or just by typing `make`. In order to get familiar with the syntax of theme used in the project please go to their [demo website](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo/demo.html)

### How to generate a version of docs for the target language

In essence, the flow of docs generation is described on the following page of [Sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/intl.html#id1). Shortly saying, there should be following steps performed:

1. `pip install sphinx-intl`
1. For each correction of an original english source test, `gettext` command should be invoked as here: `make gettext`
1. Update/create locale for docs invoking the sphinx-intl binary: `sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l de -l ja`, which creates Japanese and German locale files.
1. Target project is generated by this command `make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D language='de'" html` (for German)

Got troubles with binary of `sphinx-intl` on Mac? Check if you have added it into PATH, usually it should be as following: `$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin`.
 
 In the future, .po files should be published into https://weblate.org or similar platform, and the process of docs translation should be incorporated into open source community process.
