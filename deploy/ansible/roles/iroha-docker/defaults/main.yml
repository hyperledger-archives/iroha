# How many Iroha peers (containers) are deployed on each host. Can be set on a per-host level.
# Minimum total nodes is 6 (5f+1) in order for consensus to work properly.
#
# Default: 6
replicas: 6

# Whether to use custom hostname for EACH container.
# If set to `true`, Iroha peers will communicate using these hostnames. Hostnames should be set using
# `hostnames` variable. See example playbook in `playbooks/iroha-docker/main.yml`.
# If set to `false`, Iroha peers will communicate by IP addresses set by `inventory_hostname`
# variable. Container and service names in Docker Compose files will be auto-generated.
#
# Default: false
custom_hostnames: false

# Affects how Iroha peers are communicated. If set to `true`, Docker overlay network with that
# name will be used. It must be created beforehand. The recommended way is to use Calico plugin
# for Docker (projectcalico.org).
# Setting it to `true` without creating the network will only work for a single host deployment
# (Iroha peers will only be able to communicate within that host). Suitable for local-only
# deployments for testing purposes.

# Default: false

## Deployment configs

# Path on a local machine for generated configs prior moving them on the remote
config_local_dir: /tmp/iroha-ansible-conf
# Path on a remote machine for generated configs
deploy_dir: /opt/iroha-deploy
# Overlay network name
# If using overlay network plugin (like Calico) the network must be created prior running this role
# The network will be created automatically if deploying locally or with `overlay_network`
# set to `false`
iroha_network_name: iroha-net

# The role is incompatible with Iroha versions below RC2 since keys format has changed.
# Apply the patch (files/old-keys-format.patch) if you need support for previous Iroha versions.

## Iroha config
# This value will be used as a base peer port for Iroha container. E.g. setting `replicas` option to
# 6 will generate Docker Compose file with port numbers starting from 10001 counting up to 10006.
# If `custom_hostnames` set to `true` AND contains port numbers this option is ignored
iroha_peer_port: 10001
# As above but for base Torii port

# Enables 2 phase commit optimization. Postgres documentation suggests setting it to a max number of
# connections, which is 100 by default
